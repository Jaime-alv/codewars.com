Here you will find solved exercises and algorithms that I have used on the platform.

### What's codewars?

Codewars is an online platform that offers user-created challenges.

Codewars is a collective effort by its users. They are creators - authoring kata to teach various 
techniques, solving kata with solutions that enlighten others, and commenting with constructive 
feedback. The leaders among them moderate the content and community.

"_Achieve mastery through challenge._

_Improve your development skills by training with your peers using coding challenges._"
